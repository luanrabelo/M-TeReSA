# Installation  

*M-TeReSA* requires the installation of **Node.JS** for its execution. Both *M-TeReSA* and **Node.JS** are cross-platforms and can be executed with the same script `M-TeReSA.js` on any operating system compatible with **Node.JS**.  

Table 1 outlines how **Node.JS** can be installed on the operating system of the user.  

The user can download the **Node.JS** version specific for their operating system at https://nodejs.org/en/download/, according to the recommendations in Table 1.
